In This project I analysed the data avaliable online on Covid-19.
And made useful insights out of it.
like - percentage of dying within a country
       infection rate compared to its population
       countries with highest death count per population
       showing continents with highest death as per population
       total New Cases, total deaths and death percentage. 
       total population vs total people new vaccinations
       this tells us about how many people in INDIA got vaccinated on each day
       total people vaacinated each day grouped by there location
       Using CTE to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query
       create view to store data for tableau visualizations
